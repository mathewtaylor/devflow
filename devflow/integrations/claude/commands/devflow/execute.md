# Execute Feature Implementation

Implement tasks for: **$1** (or active feature)

## Current State

- Active feature: !`node .devflow/lib/cli.js query active_feature`
- Feature exists: !`node .devflow/lib/cli.js query feature_exists "$1"`

## Your Task

**IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**
- Follow the execution loop exactly as specified below
- Do NOT skip quality gates (code review, testing) unless explicitly allowed by user
- Use ONLY the allowed tools listed in frontmatter
- Pause/resume supported - save progress to state.json at each step
- Use three-state checkbox system in tasks.md

---

## Task Structure and Checkbox System

**Hierarchical Task Format:**

Tasks.md uses a hierarchical structure with parent tasks and subtasks:
```markdown
[ ] 1. Parent Task Title (effort: high)
- [ ] 1.1. First subtask
- [ ] 1.2. Second subtask
- [ ] 1.3. Third subtask

[ ] 2. Another Parent Task (effort: medium)
- [ ] 2.1. Subtask description
- [ ] 2.2. Another subtask
```

**Three-State Checkbox System:**
- `[ ]` = Not started
- `[-]` = In progress (parent task only)
- `[x]` = Complete

**Checkbox Rules:**
- **Parent tasks:** Mark `[-]` when starting first subtask, `[x]` when all subtasks complete
- **Subtasks:** Mark `[x]` immediately when subtask passes review/tests

**Execution Flow:**
1. Show confirmation ONCE per parent task
2. Execute subtasks sequentially (1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 2.1)
3. Track current subtask in state.json (e.g., "1.2")
4. Mark checkboxes as work progresses
5. When resuming, continue from saved subtask

---

### Setup Phase

1. **Determine target feature:**
   - If $1 provided: Find matching feature key
   - If not: Use active_feature from state.json
   - If none: Show available features and error

2. **Validate feature:**
   - Must have tasks.md file
   - If missing: Error "Run /tasks first"

3. **Activate feature** (if not already active):
   - Invoke State Manager to set status="active"
   - Update active_feature in state.json

4. **Load context:**

@.devflow/constitution.md
@.devflow/architecture.md
@.devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/spec.md
@.devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/plan.md
@.devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/tasks.md

**Load relevant domain docs** based on feature's `concerns` array from state.json

---

### Execution Loop

Parse tasks.md to identify parent tasks (1, 2, 3) and their subtasks (1.1, 1.2, 1.3).

**For each parent task from current position to end:**

#### 1. Display Parent Task (Confirmation Point)

**Check if this is a Review Checkpoint parent task:**

If parent task title contains "Review Checkpoint" (e.g., "3. Review Checkpoint: Data Layer Complete"):
- **Skip normal subtask iteration** - this is a checkpoint, not implementation
- Go directly to **Section 3B: Execute Review Checkpoint** (below)

**For normal parent tasks:**

**Proactive Snapshot Suggestion (if applicable):**

If parent task has >5 subtasks AND snapshot doesn't already exist:
```
💡 Large parent task ahead ({{subtask_count}} subtasks).

Update snapshot before starting? (y/n)

This helps resume if the session is interrupted during this
lengthy parent task.
```

If yes: Follow Pause Handling snapshot creation steps (gather data, create snapshot.md, update state)
If no: Continue to parent task confirmation

**Parent Task Confirmation:**

Show this ONCE per parent task:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
Parent Task {{parent_number}}: {{parent_title}} ({{effort}})
Subtasks: {{subtask_list}} ({{subtask_count}} total)
{{#if parent_in_progress}}Status: IN PROGRESS ({{completed_count}}/{{subtask_count}} complete){{/if}}
─────────────────────────────────────────

This will implement all subtasks under this parent task.
Continue? (y/n/skip/pause)
  y - Implement all subtasks in this parent
  n - Stop execution
  skip - Mark all subtasks complete without implementing (use cautiously)
  pause - Save progress and exit
```

**If continuing:**

- Mark parent task in tasks.md: `[ ]` → `[-]` (if not already `[-]`)
- Begin iterating through subtasks

#### 2. For Each Subtask Under Current Parent

**Display subtask:**
```
Starting subtask {{subtask_number}}: {{subtask_description}}
{{#if dependencies}}Dependencies: {{dependencies}}{{/if}}
```

**Check Dependencies:**

If subtask has `[depends: x.y]`:
- Verify those subtasks are marked `[x]` in tasks.md
- If not: Show which are incomplete, offer to:
  - Jump to incomplete dependency
  - Skip this subtask for now
  - Exit

#### 3. Implement Task

Based on task description:
- Write code following constitution standards
- Create new files or modify existing
- Follow patterns from architecture.md
- Apply relevant domain documentation rules
- Log what you're doing for implementation.md

---

### 3B. Execute Review Checkpoint (Review Checkpoint Parent Tasks Only)

**CRITICAL: This section only applies when parent task title contains "Review Checkpoint".**

**Check configuration:**

Read constitution.md for `quality_gates.checkpoint_review` setting:
- If `false`: Log "Checkpoint review disabled", mark parent task complete, skip to next parent
- If `true` or not specified (default): Continue with checkpoint review

**Collect checkpoint scope:**

1. **Find last checkpoint**: Search tasks.md backwards for previous "Review Checkpoint" parent task
   - If none found: Checkpoint scope starts from feature beginning
   - If found: Checkpoint scope starts from task after that checkpoint
2. **Identify reviewed parent tasks**: All parent tasks between last checkpoint and current checkpoint
   - Example: If last checkpoint was task 3, and current is task 7, review parent tasks 4, 5, 6
3. **Collect all files changed**:
   - Read implementation.md for "Files Modified" sections for each parent task in scope
   - Create comprehensive list of all created/modified files
4. **Extract requirements**:
   - From spec.md: Requirements for all reviewed parent tasks
   - Parse phase section name from checkpoint title (e.g., "Data Layer Complete" → Phase 1: Data Layer)
5. **Extract design**:
   - From plan.md: Technical design for all reviewed parent tasks

**Check context before review:**

```
Current context usage: {{current_tokens}}/200,000 tokens
```

- If > 150K tokens (75% of budget):
  ```
  ⚠️ Context Warning: {{current_tokens}}/200,000 tokens ({{percentage}}%)

  Running checkpoint review with high context may fail mid-review.

  Options:
  a) Compact now before review (recommended)
  b) Continue anyway (may need to compact during fixes)

  Choose:
  ```
- If user chooses compact: Run `/compact`, then resume checkpoint review
- If user chooses continue: Proceed to review

**Invoke Checkpoint Reviewer (Attempt 1):**

Use Task tool to invoke checkpoint-reviewer agent:

```
Task tool invocation:
- subagent_type: "checkpoint-reviewer"
- description: "Checkpoint review: {{phase_name}}"
- prompt: """
  Perform comprehensive checkpoint review with extended thinking.

  **Checkpoint:** {{checkpoint_parent_number}}. Review Checkpoint: {{phase_name}} Complete
  **Scope:** Parent tasks {{list, e.g., 1, 2}} ({{count}} tasks)
  **Since:** {{last_checkpoint_number or "feature start"}}

  **Files Changed in Checkpoint Scope:**
  {{comprehensive list of all files created/modified}}

  **Spec Requirements for This Phase:**
  {{extract requirements from spec.md for all reviewed parent tasks}}

  **Technical Plan for This Phase:**
  {{extract design from plan.md for all reviewed parent tasks}}

  **Context:**
  @constitution.md
  @architecture.md

  **Checkpoint Review Focus:**
  1. Integration: Do all parent tasks in this phase work together?
  2. Spec alignment: Are ALL phase requirements met?
  3. Architecture compliance: Matches plan.md and architecture patterns?
  4. Security: Any vulnerabilities introduced across phase?
  5. Code quality: Bad practices, code smells, duplication across files?
  6. Cross-cutting concerns: Performance, maintainability, testability?

  **Severity Classification Required:**
  Categorize ALL issues by severity:
  - CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, breaking bugs
  - HIGH: Spec violations, architecture breaks, missing requirements
  - MEDIUM: Code quality, potential bugs, missing tests
  - LOW: Style, minor optimizations, suggestions

  Use extended thinking for deep cross-component analysis.

  Return structured feedback with status and severity-categorized issues.
  """

```

---

## Post-Implementation Steps (After Review + Tests Pass)

**CRITICAL: Follow this exact sequence for each subtask to maintain consistency.**

### Execution Order

After code review ✓ and tests ✓ pass for a subtask, complete these steps in order:

**STEP A: Update tasks.md checkboxes** (Section 6)
- Use Edit tool to mark subtask `[x]`
- Use Edit tool to update parent if needed (`[-]` or `[x]`)
- **If Edit fails**: Retry once with more context, then pause execution

**STEP B: Invoke State Manager** (Section 7)
- Use Task tool with state-manager agent
- Request current_task update to completed subtask number (e.g., "1.2")
- **If State Manager fails**: Show error, ask user how to proceed

**STEP C: Log to implementation.md** (Section 6)
- Append completed subtask details
- Include parent task context
- Record review and test results

**STEP D: Check remaining work** (Section 8)
- If more subtasks in current parent: Continue to next subtask
- If parent complete: Show completion message, move to next parent
- If all tasks complete: Go to Completion Flow

### Error Handling and Consistency

**State Consistency Policy:**
- Steps A and B must both succeed for consistent state
- If Step A succeeds but Step B fails: State is inconsistent (tasks.md ✓, state.json ✗)
- On resume: Derive position from BOTH tasks.md checkboxes AND state.json current_task
- Resolution: If mismatch, tasks.md is source of truth - update state.json to match

**Rollback is NOT supported:**
- Once checkboxes are marked, they stay marked
- If state update fails, fix state.json on next attempt
- This prevents losing progress if execution is interrupted

---

#### 6. Mark Subtask Complete

**CRITICAL: Use Edit tool to update tasks.md checkboxes**

**STEP 1: Mark current subtask complete**

Use Edit tool to update tasks.md:
- Find exact line: `- [ ] {{subtask_number}}. {{description}}`
- Replace with: `- [x] {{subtask_number}}. {{description}}`

Example:
- Old: `- [ ] 1.2. Create user service implementation`
- New: `- [x] 1.2. Create user service implementation`

**If Edit fails:** Retry once with more context (include parent line), then pause execution and alert user.

**STEP 2: Check and update parent task checkbox**

After marking subtask complete, read tasks.md to check parent status:

1. Count remaining `[ ]` subtasks under this parent
2. If **all subtasks are now `[x]`**:
   - Use Edit tool to find: `[-] {{parent_number}}. {{parent_title}}`
   - Replace with: `[x] {{parent_number}}. {{parent_title}}`
3. If **subtasks still remain**:
   - Parent stays as `[-]` (in progress) - no edit needed

**Example sequence:**
```markdown
Before (completing subtask 1.2):
[-] 1. Parent Task (effort: high)
- [x] 1.1. First subtask
- [ ] 1.2. Second subtask ← completing this one
- [ ] 1.3. Third subtask

After Edit (subtask 1.2):
[-] 1. Parent Task (effort: high)  ← stays [-] (still has 1.3)
- [x] 1.1. First subtask
- [x] 1.2. Second subtask
- [ ] 1.3. Third subtask

After completing 1.3:
[x] 1. Parent Task (effort: high)  ← Edit changes [-] to [x] (all done)
- [x] 1.1. First subtask
- [x] 1.2. Second subtask
- [x] 1.3. Third subtask
```

**Create/append to implementation.md:**

```markdown
## Subtask {{subtask_number}}: {{subtask_description}}
**Parent Task:** {{parent_number}}. {{parent_title}}
**Completed:** {{ISO timestamp}}
{{#if dependencies}}**Dependencies:** {{dependencies}}{{/if}}

### Implementation
{{summary of what was done}}

### Code Review
{{#if skipped}}

{{else}}
✓ {{passed}}/{{total}} tests passed
✓ Coverage: {{coverage}}%
{{/if}}

### Files Modified
{{list of files created/modified}}

---
```

#### 7. Update State

**Use Task tool to invoke State Manager agent:**

```
Task tool invocation:
- subagent_type: "state-manager"
- description: "Update current task progress"
- prompt: "Update current_task to '{{subtask_number}}' for active feature. Use state-io.js utilities (readState, writeState, validateSchema). Return success status."
```

Example: For subtask 1.2:
```
Task(state-manager): "Update current_task to '1.2' for active feature. Validate schema before writing."
```

**Handle State Manager response:**

If response contains `success: false`:
- Show error details to user
- Options:
  - `retry` - Invoke State Manager again
  - `continue` - Continue without state update (not recommended)
  - `pause` - Pause execution for manual intervention
  - `manual` - Show user how to fix manually with Bash

If response contains `success: true`:
- Log confirmation: `✓ State updated: current_task = "{{subtask_number}}"`
- Continue to next step

**State after successful update:**
```json
{
  "current_task": "{{subtask_number}}",  // e.g., "1.2", "2.1"
  "phase": "EXECUTE",
  "status": "active"
}
```

Parent task number is derived by parsing current_task string ("1.2" → parent 1, subtask 2).

**If last subtask of parent task:**
- Display: `✓ Parent Task {{parent_number}} complete ({{subtask_count}}/{{subtask_count}} subtasks)`
- **Check context usage** (see Context Management below)
- Move to next parent task
- Show next parent task confirmation

**If last subtask of entire feature:**
- Transition to phase=DONE, status=completed
- Go to **Completion Flow**

---

### Context Management (After Parent Task Completion)

**CRITICAL: After completing each parent task, check context usage before continuing.**

**Check current context:**
- Claude Code tracks token usage throughout the session
- Current budget: 200,000 tokens
- Warning threshold: 150,000 tokens (75% usage)

**If context usage > 150K tokens:**

```
⚠️ Context Warning

Current usage: {{current_tokens}}/200,000 tokens ({{percentage}}%)
Remaining: {{remaining_tokens}} tokens

Large context may impact performance and increase costs.

Options:
a) Compact context now (recommended - creates summary and continues fresh)
b) Continue without compacting (may hit limit during next phase)
c) Pause execution (save progress and exit)

Choose:
```

**If user chooses "compact":**
1. **Suggest snapshot creation first:**
   ```
   💡 Create/update snapshot before compacting? (y/n)

   Recommended: Snapshot helps resume after /compact resets context.
   ```

   If yes: Follow Pause Handling snapshot creation steps
   If no: Continue to compact

2. Use `/compact` command to create conversation summary
3. Context resets with summary preserved
4. Resume execution from next parent task
5. All progress saved in state.json, tasks.md, and snapshot.md (if created)

**If user chooses "continue":**
- Log warning to implementation.md
- Continue to next parent task
- May need to compact mid-phase if limit reached

**If user chooses "pause":**
- Follow Pause Handling procedure (section below)

**If context usage < 150K tokens:**
- No action needed, continue silently

**Auto-compact option (optional enhancement):**
- If implementing auto-compact: Set threshold to 170K tokens
- Automatically run `/compact` without asking
- Log compaction to implementation.md
- Note: User preference - some may prefer manual control

---

#### 8. Continue Through Subtasks

Continue automatically to next subtask in same parent (no confirmation between subtasks).

When parent task complete or all feature tasks complete: Show appropriate completion message

---

### Pause Handling

When user chooses "pause":

**Step 1: Verify state saved**
- Current subtask is already saved in state.json (e.g., "1.2")
- Tasks.md shows current state with checkboxes:
  - Parent tasks: `[x]` complete, `[-]` in progress, `[ ]` not started
  - Subtasks: `[x]` complete, `[ ]` not done

**Step 2: Offer snapshot creation**
```
Create/update snapshot for easy resume? (y/n)

This creates a summary in snapshot.md to help resume after
Claude Code's /compact or session interruptions.
```

**Step 3: If yes, create snapshot:**

1. **Read template:** `.devflow/templates/snapshot.md.template`

2. **Gather snapshot data:**
   - **Feature metadata:**
     - FEATURE_NAME: display_name from state.json
     - FEATURE_KEY: featureKey
     - PHASE: phase from state.json
     - STATUS: status from state.json (should be "paused")
     - SNAPSHOT_TIMESTAMP: Current timestamp (ISO 8601)

   - **Progress metrics:**
     - Count tasks.md checkboxes: `[x]` vs total subtasks
     - COMPLETED_TASKS: count of `[x]` subtasks
     - TOTAL_TASKS: count of all subtasks (under all `- [ ]` or `- [-]` or `- [x]` parent tasks)
     - PROGRESS_PERCENT: (COMPLETED_TASKS / TOTAL_TASKS * 100).toFixed(0)

   - **Current position:**
     - CURRENT_TASK: current_task from state.json (e.g., "1.2")
     - CURRENT_PARENT: extract parent number (e.g., "1.2" → "1")
     - PARENT_TITLE: extract from tasks.md (parent task 1's title)
     - CURRENT_SUBTASK_DESCRIPTION: extract from tasks.md

   - **Phase progress:**
     - List all phase sections in tasks.md with completion status
     - Format: "Phase 1: Complete (5/5), Phase 2: In Progress (2/8), Phase 3: Not Started (0/12)"

   - **Recent work:**
     - Read implementation.md, extract last 3-5 completed subtask entries
     - Include: subtask number, title, completion timestamp
     - Format as bulleted list

   - **Files modified:**
     - Scan implementation.md for all "Files Modified:" sections
     - Deduplicate file paths
     - Format as bulleted list with file paths

   - **Review status:**
     - Find last checkpoint review in implementation.md
     - Extract: checkpoint name, status (APPROVED/ISSUES), issue count if any

   - **Issues:**
     - Scan recent checkpoint reviews for warnings/issues
     - Summarize: "No issues" or "3 MEDIUM issues accepted, see implementation.md"

   - **Next steps:**
     - NEXT_SUBTASK_DETAILS: Description of current_task subtask
     - REMAINING_SUBTASKS: List remaining `[ ]` subtasks in current parent
     - UPCOMING_PARENT_TASKS: List next 1-2 `[ ]` parent tasks

   - **Context notes:**
     - "Paused during Parent Task {{CURRENT_PARENT}} execution"
     - Add any warnings about approaching token limits if relevant

3. **Fill template and write file:**
   - Use Write tool to create `.devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/snapshot.md`
   - Replace all `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values with gathered data
   - **Note:** This overwrites existing snapshot.md if present

4. **Update state.json:**
   - Invoke State Manager agent with:
     ```
     Update feature {{featureKey}}:
     - Set snapshot: "snapshot.md"
     ```

**Step 4: Confirm pause:**
```
⏸️ Execution paused

Feature: {{display_name}}
Progress: {{completed_tasks}}/{{total_tasks}} subtasks complete
Current: Subtask {{current_task}} (in Parent Task {{current_parent}})
{{#if snapshot_created}}
✓ Snapshot saved: .devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/snapshot.md
{{/if}}

Resume: /execute (without arguments)
```

**If no (skip snapshot):**
- Invoke State Manager to set `snapshot: null` if it was previously set
- Display pause confirmation without snapshot message

---

### Completion Flow

When all tasks are marked complete:

```
🎉 All implementation tasks complete!

Summary:
- Feature: {{display_name}}
- Tasks completed: {{total_tasks}}
- Files modified: {{file_count}}
- Tests added: {{test_count}}
- Time: {{duration if trackable}}
```

**1. Clean Up Snapshot**

If snapshot exists:
1. **Check state.json** for snapshot value
2. **If not null:**
   - Construct path: `.devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/snapshot.md`
   - If file exists, delete it using Bash: `rm .devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/snapshot.md`
   - Confirm: `✓ Snapshot cleared (implementation complete)`

**2. Transition to Validation Phase**

Invoke State Manager to:
- Set phase=VALIDATE (not DONE - validation phase comes next)
- Keep status=active
- Keep feature as active_feature (validation continues on same feature)

**3. Implementation Complete!**

```
✅ Implementation complete: {{display_name}}!

Documentation:
- Spec: features/{{key}}/spec.md
- Plan: features/{{key}}/plan.md
- Tasks: features/{{key}}/tasks.md ({{total}} ✓)
- Implementation: features/{{key}}/implementation.md

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🔍 Next: Validation Phase
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Implementation is done, but the feature needs validation testing
before it can be marked complete.

**Start validation:**
  /validate

This will:
  - Parse acceptance criteria from spec.md
  - Create validation.md tracking document
  - Set up intelligent bug reporting

**During validation:**
  - Test each acceptance criterion
  - Report bugs: /test-fail "<error logs or description>"
  - Mark passing: /test-pass <criterion-number>
  - Check progress: /validate-status

**When all tests pass:**
  - Finalize: /validate-complete
  - Generates retrospective and marks feature DONE

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Start validation now: /validate
```

## Error Recovery

### Review Rejection After 3 Attempts
- Show user the persistent issues
- Offer to continue anyway, skip, pause, or get manual help
- Log the decision

### Test Failure After 3 Attempts
- Show failing tests
- Offer to continue anyway (tests marked incomplete), skip, pause, or get manual help
- Log the decision

### Task Implementation Failure
If an error occurs during implementation:
```
❌ Error implementing task: {{error message}}

Options:
a) Retry
b) Skip this task
c) Pause execution
d) Manual intervention needed

Choose:
```

## Resume Behavior

When `/execute` runs without arguments and active_feature exists:

**Step 1: Check for snapshot**

Read state.json to get snapshot value:
- If `snapshot` is not null (e.g., "snapshot.md")
- Construct full path: `.devflow/features/{{featureKey}}/snapshot.md`
- Check if file exists and is readable

**Step 2: Load and display snapshot (if exists)**

If snapshot file exists:
1. **Read snapshot.md**
2. **Extract key information:**
   - Progress percentage
   - Last completed subtask
   - Files modified (count)
   - Issues summary
3. **Display snapshot summary:**
   ```
   📸 Loading snapshot...

   Last session summary:
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   Progress: {{completed}}/{{total}} subtasks ({{percent}}%)
   Last completed: Subtask {{last_number}} - {{last_title}}
   Files modified: {{file_count}} files
   {{#if issues}}Issues noted: {{issue_summary}}{{/if}}
   ─────────────────────────────────────────
   ```

**Step 3: Parse current position**

Parse current_task from state.json (e.g., "1.2"):
- Extract parent task number by parsing string (e.g., "1.2" → parent is 1)
- Extract subtask number (e.g., "1.2" is subtask 2 of parent 1)
- Determine which subtasks in parent are complete by reading tasks.md checkboxes

**Step 4: Display resume information**
```
Resuming feature: {{display_name}}
Progress: {{completed_subtask_count}}/{{total_subtask_count}} subtasks completed

Parent Task {{parent_number}}: {{parent_title}} ({{status}})
├─ Completed: {{list of completed subtasks with [x]}}
└─ Next: Subtask {{current_task}} - {{subtask_description}}

Remaining in this parent: {{remaining_subtasks}}

Continue from where you left off? (y/n)
```

**Step 5: If continuing**
- If resuming mid-parent (parent marked `[-]`): Continue with subtasks, no new confirmation
- If resuming at new parent (parent marked `[ ]`): Show parent task confirmation prompt
- Snapshot remains in place (not deleted on resume)
- Will be updated on next pause or deleted on feature completion

## Notes

- **Token management**: If context gets large (>50K tokens), offer to create snapshot and continue with fresh context
- **Git integration**: If git available, use `git diff` to show exact changes for code review
- **Incremental saves**: implementation.md updates after each task, never lose progress
- **Flexible workflow**: Can skip non-critical tasks, pause anytime, jump to dependencies

Execute with confidence - every task is reviewed and tested before proceeding.
